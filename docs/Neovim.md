# Neovim

Neovim is mostly configured in the flake, we just need to install packer
separately, although this is only required to do once.

## Installation

Run the following command in the terminal

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
